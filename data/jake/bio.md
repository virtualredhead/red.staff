I really didn’t go to school, but I've done alright figuring things out for
myself. I worked at the LCC Computer lab for a while. I took some film classes,
but not very seriously. I spend a lot of time on Github, I follow a number of
developers that I think are doing good work. I pay attention to the FIG
(framework interop group), and other standards bodies. I waste a lot of time on
IRC.

At Redhead I write custom content management systems and web applications,
primarily with PHP. I administrate our servers as well, mostly Linux machines.
I'm a fan of open source software. I like open standards and interoperability.

I like creative problem solving with computers. I like making clever, elegant
solutions to problems and building structured systems that organize information.
I'm pretty good with a yoyo. I can pogo stick pretty good. I'm not a pro, but I
can solve a Rubik’s Cube pretty fast. I think math is cool.
