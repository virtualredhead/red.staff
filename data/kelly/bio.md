Hello, I’m Kelly, the quiet kid in the corner — usually puzzling out a design,
drawing, or daydreaming.

From a young age, I knew I would one day have a creative career. Mainly
because if an assignment in school didn’t involve coloring, glitter, or
finger-paint, I found it extremely dull. Over the years I have dreamed about
what career I might have. I’ve imagined myself a game designer, an illustrator
of children’s books (still something I dream about), a painter with my art hung
in galleries, and even a concept artist at Pixar living way out in California.
Other than being creative endeavors, it might not seem like those things are
all that similar. But at their core, they all bring joy. Deep down, I always
wanted my work to be a ray of sunshine on a cloudy day.

I studied Art and Design at Lansing Community College and then at Northern
Michigan University. After briefly considering animation (another imagined
career path), I committed to a degree in graphic communications. Design
allows me to dabble in so many areas of art that I love, but most
importantly, it is transforming dull, mundane things into rainbows and
butterflies. At least, that’s how I look at it. Most people just call it
“nice design.”

When I can, I love to use cheery color schemes, fun illustrative elements,
and anything remotely quirky. Here at Redhead, I feel like I have found my
dream job (because, let’s be honest, being a designer at a creative firm in a
big city was definitely on my list). I get to create beautiful designs that
motivate, inspire, and hopefully radiate a bit of joy to whoever interacts
with them.

Probably not very surprising...when I’m not designing I’m drawing by the lake
near my apartment, wandering the children’s section at the local bookstore,
playing video games with my sisters, watching animated films, reading terrible
YA fantasy, writing terrible YA fantasy, or running my Etsy shop.
