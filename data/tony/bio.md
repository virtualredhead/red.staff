I always search for the simplest answer first. Powerful, elegant solutions
need not be overcomplicated or overengineered. In my eyes, glitz and glamor
fall flat without sound strategy taking precedence.

Web development is exciting for many reasons, but most of all because of the
sheer amount of people a website can reach. When executed properly, a website
is one of the most powerful storytelling tools available. Websites are the
product of collaboration and combined effort &mdash; seeing all that work come to
fruition on launch day is one of my favorite things about the job.

I graduated from Michigan State University with bachelor degrees in finance
and computer science, then worked at MSU for 21 years. Now I’m here at
Redhead &mdash; all by chance. I was biking around Downtown Lansing when I started
to follow the sounds of live music. It led me to just outside the Redhead
office where I spotted Jen. Two days later, I accepted a job offer.

Needless to say, biking is a favorite activity of mine and I often bike to
the office. I run a drone photography business and enjoy photographing
landscapes and my dog, Hamish. It’s hard to find a better subject.
